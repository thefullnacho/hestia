## 2026-08-11 — DNS layer audit and remediation

Triggered by a question about AdGuard blocking traffic from a phone app. The answer was
boring, the things found underneath it were not.

**The original question, answered.** The blocked domains were analytics, log upload, event
collection and device-fingerprinting endpoints. Every block in the trailing 19 days was a
blocklist rule match, none were threat detections. The app's functional endpoints resolved
normally throughout, and the blocked hosts were re-queried at a low steady rate rather than
in retry storms, which is what a genuinely broken dependency looks like. No action needed.

**Three real gaps found in the DNS layer.**

1. *Blocks cannot mean "malware" on this deployment.* SafeBrowsing and parental filtering
   are both off, so every block is a list match by construction. Deliberately not enabling
   SafeBrowsing: it sends a hash prefix of every domain to a third party, which breaks
   invariant 5. The gap should close with local lists instead.
2. *No per-device attribution.* The router forwards DNS on behalf of clients, so every
   query in the log carries the router's address. Questions of the form "which device did
   this" are unanswerable as configured. The router's firmware exposes no LAN DHCP DNS
   option, so the only routes are per-device manual DNS or moving DHCP to the resolver.
3. *DNS-over-HTTPS bypass is open.* A client is actively bootstrapping encrypted DNS to a
   third-party resolver, 850 lookups in the window. Any client on DoH is invisible to
   filtering entirely. Unresolved.

**Incident, caused and fixed in-session.** Pointing the router's secondary resolver at
AdGuard unmasked a latent reverse-DNS loop: private PTR resolution was configured to use the
host's system resolver, which is the router, which now forwarded back to AdGuard. Each
lookup hung for two seconds and drained the worker pool until real queries timed out. The
external secondary had been the accidental escape hatch. Compounding it, the per-client rate
limit was being applied to the whole household, because the household presents as one
client. Both settings corrected via the AdGuard UI, resolution and filtering verified.

Lesson recorded: read a service's own upstream and PTR configuration before changing what
points at it.

**Correction.** The change was recommended on the grounds that the external secondary was
leaking a share of household browsing unfiltered. That was asserted from general resolver
behavior and never verified. Measured afterwards, steady-state query rate returned to its
prior baseline rather than stepping up, which is not what a real leak produces. The claim is
withdrawn. Pointing both entries at the local resolver is still correct, but for the smaller
reason of removing ambiguity. Note the vantage problem: the resolver cannot observe queries
that never reach it, so this remains weakly evidenced in both directions.

### Done same night: the watchdog gap

The off-site watchdog now runs three independently-tracked probes instead of one, on the
existing 5 minute timer and the existing ntfy channel:

| Probe | Catches | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `brain` | house dark, as before | urgent |
| `dns` | resolver up but not resolving, the exact failure from tonight | urgent |
| `dns-filtering` | resolution fine, blocklists silently not applied | high |

Each keeps its own state, so one cannot mask another. The filtering check is skipped when
resolution is down, because a dead resolver answers nothing for everything and would
otherwise read as a false pass. Both failure and recovery transitions were fired against a
throwaway ntfy topic and a scratch state directory before being trusted, so this is a tested
alert rather than a written one.

Also documented: `SECURITY.md` gained a threat model, and external exposure was measured
rather than assumed. The home perimeter is fully closed; the off-site host exposes only the
ports its firewall intends.

### In flight

- DoH bypass unaddressed. A client is using encrypted DNS to a third-party resolver, which
  no amount of local filtering or logging can see.
- Threat coverage still rests on a single aggregated feed.
- Per-device DNS attribution still missing, so the new probes can say the house is broken
  but not which device is misbehaving.
- On the off-site host, the panel database listens on all interfaces and is not exposed only
  because the firewall says so. It should bind to loopback.

### Next concrete action

A full-day query-volume comparison against the trailing baseline to settle
the leak question properly `[non-production]`; local phishing and malware-distribution
lists, added one at a time so false positives are attributable; and `dns-watch`, a
timer-driven deterministic feed into the existing ntfy channel and `snapshot()`. `dns-watch`
is worth more after per-device DNS lands, so it is sequenced last. Detection stays in
timers and row comparisons, never the model.

### Non-production, queued

- `[non-production]` Per-device DNS on the machines worth attributing. Router cannot hand
  it out.
- `[non-production]` Passwordless sudo across the boxes. Scoped NOPASSWD for container and
  service control is the lighter option.
